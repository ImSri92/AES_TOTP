# AES_TOTP
TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) based authentication, Caesar cipher decryption, and AES encryption/decryption.
I would like to explain the above Python code, which demonstrates a combination of TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) based authentication, Caesar cipher decryption, and AES encryption/decryption.

The code starts by importing the required libraries, such as Crypto.Cipher for AES, Crypto.Random for generating random bytes, Crypto.Util.Padding for data padding, pyotp for TOTP, qrcode for QR code generation, and os for interacting with the operating system.

The verify_otp(secret, otp) function takes a TOTP secret and a one-time password (OTP) as input and returns True if the OTP is valid, otherwise False. The generate_key() function generates a random 256-bit AES key using get_random_bytes. The save_key(key, filename) and load_key(filename) functions save and load the AES key to and from a file, respectively.

The encrypt_data(key, data) and decrypt_data(key, iv, ciphertext) functions are responsible for encrypting and decrypting data using AES. The caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift) function is responsible for decrypting a Caesar cipher with a given shift value.

In the main function, a random key is generated and saved to a file. Then the key is loaded from the file, and a TOTP secret is generated. A QR code containing the TOTP provisioning URI is created and saved to a file. The user is prompted to set up the OTP Authenticator app using the provisioning URI.

After setting up the app, the user is asked to enter the OTP generated by the app. If the OTP is valid, the code proceeds to decrypt the Caesar cipher text from a text file using the caesar_decrypt() function. The decrypted text is then encrypted using AES with the generated key.

The encrypted data is saved to a file, and then read from the file to be decrypted. The decrypted data is printed to the console. This code demonstrates a secure way to authenticate a user using TOTP and protect sensitive data using a combination of Caesar cipher decryption and AES encryption.
